<p>1. I was up til 4 listening through some Deltarune songs and then started playing around with the tempo for some reason 	because after speeding up "Dump", that song in Chapter 3, it sounded like the whole melody itself is just half of the "HEY 	EVERY   !" motif. It plays in the background too obviously but it's also just the melody but super slowed (to me) </p>
	<p> And i haven't really gotten around to the Mike theories yet but Catswing is full of motifs and thinking about it, I feel like 	the song's making fun of us like "ha ha oh all those motifs you hear in this one song...i bet you're theorizing on what it could 	mean, huh? Well guess what. All your theories are wrong." Maybe that's just me. There's like several Undertale motifs in the Honk 	Song from chapter 2 so

   <br>If you don't get yourself a place with a washer and dryer included, buy used. Facebook marketplace, OfferUp, Craigslist. They all have people on their that will sell theirs for next to nothing when doing remodels or for whatever reason. Just be sure that it's in good working order before you take possession - if you can.

    <br>If money is an object of stress, remember this: don't undervalue ramen, eat cheaply across the board, make your own coffee, and be sure to store away a little money for you to do something for yourself at intervals that will allow you stay sane and not go broke.

    <br>Goodwill is not cheap anymore. They take the good stuff and sell it online, so you rarely will find what you need in stores. Again, buy on FB, OfferUp, or Craigslist for furniture.

    <br>Walmart, Target, and some larger Kroger stores all have cheap clothing. I buy shirts from all three of them for around $6/shirt. They last months if not years and keep me from buying expensive stuff that I will out grow or wear out too quickly.

    <br>Do small things everyday to make your home clean. Clean while you cook. Straighten up the living room before bed... Anything small will help you from getting overwhelmed from a messy house and the depressing feelings of having to do the hours of cleanup.

   <br> If it's a older home, go to the hardware store and get insulation "covers" for your outlets. There's a lot of air that creeps in from your outlets and will make your energy costs go up. You can do things like chalk cracks in your place (with landlord permission).

    Keep your thermostat set at 66-68 in the winter and 73-75 in the summer. Your energy bill will reflect it in a positive way if you do it.

    <br>The library is a great place to "chill" in the summer time if you're broke and the house is hot - or cold in the winter.



<br>Take pictures before you move in. This is proof of what your apartment looks like before you moved in(no way the landlord can take your damage Deposit when you leave). Set up bed first as you’ll be tired. Make a mock budget of your necessities like rent, hydro, water, internet, phone etc. Read your renting agreement. Have a support network as it’s a big change being alone. Save up a few months rent in case something like an injury that cuts back your hours or being fired. Kitchen, bathroom and bedroom are best to get running first. 



Get everything in writing, and keep physical copies of everything you are required to sign.
